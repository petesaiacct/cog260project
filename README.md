# cog260project

 **Run Arousal_Valence_Colex_Analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook to see methodology and results**

The aim of this project was to test the hypothesis that the valence of emotional affect and the valence of arousal are both influences on the frequency of colexification of words. To do this, we used the CLICS database and applied arousal and emotional affect ratings to pairs of colexified concepts. The results showed that there was a significant relationship between the valence of arousal and emotional affect and the frequency of colexification. This finding suggests that there may be a "goldilocks" effect, where the optimal level of arousal and emotional affect leads to the greatest frequency of colexification. Further research is needed to explore this potential relationship.

The study of colexification, or the use of a single word to express multiple related concepts, has been a topic of interest in the field of linguistics for some time. Previous research has identified several factors that influence the use of colexification, such as cultural similarity and shared semantic features. However, the role of emotional affect and arousal in shaping the frequency of colexification has not yet been fully explored in a way that considers these measures as behaving like semantic information.
In this project, I set out to test the hypothesis that the valence of emotional affect and arousal are both influential factors on the frequency of colexification. My hypothesis are justified by previous research, such as the Goldilocks Principle in colexification proposed by Brochhagen and Boleda (2022), which suggests that there is an optimal level of semantic similarity which leads to a curvilinear shaped frequency of colexification. Additionally, studies by Di Natale et al. (2021) and Isbell et al. (2013) have shown that affective meaning is encoded in colexification networks, and that affect can serve as a cue for machine learning prediction of colexified pairs. 
To test my hypothesis, I will use the CLICS database and apply arousal and emotional affect ratings to pairs of colexified concepts. By analyzing the relationship between the valence of arousal and emotional affect and the frequency of colexification, I aim to determine whether these factors are indeed influential in shaping the use of colexification. The null hypotheses for this study are that the emotional affect ratings and arousal ratings of the highest quartile of colexified pairs will not differ from the mean of the population. The alternative hypotheses are that the emotional affect ratings and arousal ratings of the highest quartile of colexified pairs will differ from the mean of the population. This research has the potential to provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of colexification and its relationship to affect and arousal. 

**The methodology is explicitly shown in the jupyter notebook Arousal_Valence_Colex_Analysis.ipynb which when fully run steps through each method**

For the first hypothesis, the affect ratings in the top quartile sample (n=9883) were significantly different from the mean ratings of the population (N=39258). The t-value of 4.314 and its p-value of 1.6194156311318802e-05 were both less than the alpha of 0.05, indicating that the affect ratings of the top quartile were significantly different from the population mean.
For the second hypothesis, the arousal ratings in the top quartile sample (n=9883) were also significantly different from the mean ratings of the population (N=39258). The t-value of -5.730 and its p-value of 1.0341512163597579e-08 were both less than the alpha of 0.05, indicating that the arousal ratings of the top quartile were significantly different from the population mean.
These results support the hypothesis that emotional affect and arousal ratings are influential in shaping the use of colexification. The significantly different ratings of the top quartile of colexified pairs suggest that affect and arousal play a role in the frequency of colexification. Further research could explore this relationship in greater detail and provide additional insights into the underlying mechanisms of colexification.
