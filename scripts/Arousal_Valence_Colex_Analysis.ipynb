    "The initial analysis uses a t-test statistic to determine if the data of interest is significant in that it deviates from\n",
    "the normal distribution at a level of significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is determined by finding the t-value>. $$t = \\frac{(\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2) - D_0}{s_p \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_1}+\\frac{1}{n_2}}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the t-value first we determine the pooled standard deviation. $$ s_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{(n_1 - 1)s_1^2 + (n_2 - 1)s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}}$$\n",

    "We will then reject the $$H_0: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = D_o $$ if the t-value is different from the critical t-value.\n",
